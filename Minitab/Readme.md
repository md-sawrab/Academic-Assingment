Suppose we want to know if the number of hours spent studying and the number of preparation exams taken affects the score that a student receives on a certain college entrance exam.
To explore this relationship, we can perform multiple linear regression using hours studied and preparation exams taken as explanatory variables and exam score as a response variable.

###### Following Datasets

###### Question

1. Fit a Multiple linear regression model relating exam score (y) to hours studied (X1) and preparation exams (X2).
2. Test for significance of regression. What conclusion can you draw?
3. Using t tests, determine the contribution of X₁ and X₂ to the model. Are both regressors X₁ and X2 necessary?
4. Comment on the value of R2 for this model.
5. Do vou have any unusual observations? Comment on your findings.
o. Caiculate the expected exam score for a student who studies for three hours and take.. one preparation exam. 7. Draw the Normal probability plot and comment on the normality of the residuals
